### What is it
NYC_Yellow_Cab_Project:
we use the data from NYC TLC: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/businesses/yellow-cab.page
we clean and analyze the data, from which we then try to discover
an optimal strategies for a taxi driver for in day base on the data 
via machine learn, statistical test, integer programing and tailored algorithm
base on graph theory.
The problem as we defined is NP-hardã€‚
After a week working on it, we are yet to delivery the best
strategies for it, due to time and life constrains for us, humans.
LOL, yes, another NP-hard problem, :P


### Define Problem
define object as: E(min the overall wait time of the day)
         & weight E(max the overall trip time of the day) for a yellow cab taxi driver
   s.t.
      distance_matirx
      wait_time_matrix
      probability matrix
      detail see notebook and algorithm.py
      
 weight: is a mapping: time -> revenue
 
### How to operate it
simply cone the repo:
``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$git clone https://github.com/ChengdaoYang/NYC_Yellow_Cab_Project.git
```
install the requiriment.txt:
``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$pip3 install requirements.txt
```
open Presentation.ipynb with jupyter notebook
and run the algorithm
